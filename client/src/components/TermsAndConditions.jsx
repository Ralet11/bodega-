                  ABOUT BODEGA Bodega is a virtual marketplace Platform that connects hungry diners with third-party service providers, including local merchants and independent delivery service providers. You may order food through the Platform to be delivered from particular merchants, including their authorized licensees and franchisees, or other purveyors of food in cities throughout the United States and other territories where Bodega provides such Services (collectively, the “Merchants”).
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Bodega is not a restaurant or food preparation entity. The Merchants available on our Platform operate independently of Bodega. Merchants are required to comply with federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the preparation, sale, and marketing of food, including, without limitation, food preparation and safety and menu disclosure. Bodega is not liable or responsible for Merchants' food preparation or safety and does not verify their compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, Bodega does not guarantee the quality of what the Merchants sell, nor does it guarantee the services provided by them, including, without limitation, in those cases where they provide the delivery services or engage another third-party delivery service. Bodega does not independently verify, and is not liable for, representations made by Merchants regarding their food, including, without limitation, any menu- or Merchant-level descriptors, disclosures, photographs or images displayed through the Platform reflecting the food prepared by the Merchants and/or delivered by Delivery Partners (defined below). By accessing the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that Merchants are solely responsible for, and Bodega shall not be liable or responsible for, the services provided to you by any Merchant or any subcontractor of any Merchant, nor shall Bodega be responsible for any acts, omissions, errors or misrepresentations made by any Merchant or any subcontractor of any Merchant.

                  Bodega is not a delivery company or a common carrier. Some deliveries are provided by Bodega's network of independent delivery service providers (“Delivery Partners”). Delivery Partners are not actual agents, apparent agents, ostensible agents, or employees of Bodega in any way. Rather, Delivery Partners have entered into agreements with Bodega which require them to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, traffic laws, requirements of the applicable motor vehicle agency, and applicable insurance requirements. By accessing the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that Delivery Partners are solely responsible for, and Bodega shall not be liable or responsible for, the delivery services provided to you by any Delivery Partner or any subcontractors of Delivery Partners, or any acts, omissions, errors or misrepresentations made by any Delivery Partner.

                  USING BODEGA
                  You may only create and hold one account on each of the separately branded properties on the Platforms (each, an “Account”) for your personal use. You may have another Account if you are using the Platform for business purposes, including as part of an enterprise Account, pursuant to a separate agreement with Bodega. In consideration of the use of the Platform and the Services, you agree that you are able to create a binding legal obligation with Bodega, and you also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

                <p className="mb-2">
                  The Platform may permit you to use the Services without an Account or without logging in to your Account (e.g. on our in-store kiosks, through our assisted phone ordering feature, or as a guest with our group order feature). If you use the Service in this manner, we may create an Account for you based on the information you provide to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your payment information, name, phone number, email address, and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Platform, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement on your behalf prior to your using the Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not authorized to use the Platform or otherwise access the Services if you are under the age of 16. If you are using the Platform on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that entity, organization, or company. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or if Bodega has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if we believe that you have breached this Agreement, Bodega has the right to immediately block your current or future use of the Platform and/or the Services (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you. If your Account is terminated for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending, current, or future account credits, Perks (defined below) or other promotional offers, and any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your Account without prior notice to you.

                <p className="mb-2">
                  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account including your password and, if applicable, any password for Facebook, Google, or other third party login. You are also responsible for all activities or any other actions that occur under or that are taken in connection with your Account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify Bodega of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including, without limitation, loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. Bodega will not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your failure to comply with (a) and/or (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else who is using your Account and/or password.

                  OUR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES POLICY
                  Some jurisdictions permit the ordering and delivery of alcoholic beverages. In such jurisdictions, if you place an order that includes any alcoholic beverage, you represent and warrant that you are at least 21 years of age. Upon delivery or pickup, as applicable, you shall present a government-issued identification card evidencing your age, consistent with applicable legal requirements. The Delivery Partner may electronically scan the identification card of the individual receiving the order to confirm that the recipient is at least 21 years of age, and the delivery may be completed. You also agree that our Delivery Partners may withhold delivery of the alcoholic beverages if you or the recipient appears intoxicated when receiving delivery of such products. If you do not comply with these terms, you agree that the alcoholic beverage(s) will not be released to you, you may forfeit the cost of such beverages, and you may be responsible for restocking fees.

                <p className="mb-2">
                  PAYMENT AND OUR CREDIT POLICY
                  Certain features of the Platform, including, without limitation, the placing or receipt of orders, may require you to make certain payments, including commissions or other fees. When paid by you, these payments are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Bodega. Bodega, in its sole discretion, may offer credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis, including, for example, in the event of an error with your order or in the amounts you were charged.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Bodega will charge, and you authorize Bodega to charge, the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. If you pay any amounts with a credit card, Bodega may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase. In the event Bodega advances payment for any of your orders placed via the Platform (e.g., if your corporate account has a line of credit), Bodega may separately send you invoices for payment of those advanced amounts. If you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant Bodega the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Please note, you are unable to complete checkout with only gift card information. In all events, you are required to provide another form of payment to submit an order, even if this payment method is not charged. Additionally, if you are a campus user and you opt to pay for a purchase with your stored-value card, on certain campuses, (i) Bodega will charge such purchase to your stored-value card and will charge any applicable fees to either your credit card or other payment on file with us, and (ii) you agree that Bodega may be unable to refund a purchase to your stored-value card and may, in its discretion, provide a refund through an alternative method.

                  Bodega reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise prices, fees, taxes, and/or surcharges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time and further reserves the right to consolidate or otherwise incorporate fees and/or surcharges into the prices listed for Merchant food and beverage items. You understand that the prices for menu items displayed through the Services may differ from the prices offered or published by Merchants for the same menu items, whether offered by the Merchant directly or on third-party websites. You also understand that such prices may not be the lowest prices at which the menu items are sold. Bodega’s white-label convenience menus source products from select third-party providers, including existing Merchants on the Bodega Platform. Prices may vary between the existing Merchant menu and the Bodega white-label convenience menu. For example, the same menu item may be available at both the existing merchant and Bodega’s white-label convenience, but the price on the existing merchant's menu may be higher than the price on Bodega’s white-label convenience menu.

Regardless of the cause, Bodega reserves the right to charge the final price after checkout, including, without limitation, all applicable transaction taxes. Bodega may also, in its sole discretion, make Perks or other promotional offers with different features and different rates available to any or all of our users. Unless made available to you, these Perks and promotional offers will have no bearing on your obligation to pay the amounts charged. For more information on these offers, please see the “Perks” section below.

The Mobile Applications may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States.

                  GOVERNING LAW

                  Venue
                  You and Bodega agree that to the extent any dispute, claim, or controversy is permitted to proceed in court (except for small claims court), it shall be brought and heard exclusively in the state and federal courts of New York County, New York.
                  The foregoing Governing Law and Venue provisions do not apply to the “Dispute Resolution” section, and we refer you to that section for the applicable provisions for such disputes.

                  DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                  PLEASE READ THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS THE WAYS YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM BODEGA AND REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS MORE CIRCUMSCRIBED DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN THERE IS IN COURT.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  I. Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure
                  There might be instances when a Dispute (as defined below) arises between you and Bodega. In those instances, Bodega is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand each other’s concerns. Therefore, for any Dispute that arises between you and Bodega, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. This includes first sending a written description of the Dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account to the following email address: disputeresolution@bodega.com. Your written description must be on an individual basis and also provide at least the following information: your name; a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute, including any transaction details; and the specific relief sought and how it was calculated. Your written description must be personally signed by you. For any Dispute that Bodega raises, we will send our written description of the Dispute to the email address associated with your account.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  You and Bodega then agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute. This might include an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference between you and Bodega if such a conference is requested by Bodega. If such an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference takes place, it shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal telephonic dispute resolution conference. If either party is represented by counsel, that party's counsel may participate in the informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, but the party also must appear at and participate in the conference. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason the Dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of the complete written description of the Dispute, you and Bodega agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.
                  To reiterate, this informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations based on a failure to comply with this Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. A party may raise non-compliance with this Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in court and/or in connection with the arbitration.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  II. Mutual Arbitration Agreement
                  You and Bodega agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement or payments by or to Bodega, or that in any way relate to your use of the Platform, the Materials, the Services, and/or other content on the Platform, your relationship with Bodega, or any other dispute with Bodega, (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory) (each, a “Dispute”) shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration. Dispute shall have the broadest possible meaning. This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This Mutual Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Arbitration Agreement, where you allege claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault arising out of your use of the Platform or Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction. Bodega will honor your election to bring your sexual assault or sexual harassment claim in a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitration, but does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement with respect to any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement or with respect to any other claim or Dispute.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, issues related to the scope, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement are for a court to decide. Also, each party retains the right to (1) elect (at any time prior to the appointment of an arbitrator) to have any claims heard in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, provided the proceeding remains in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction, and (2) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other confidential or proprietary information or intellectual property rights. For clarity, this “Dispute Resolution” section does not alter, amend, or affect any of the rights or obligations of the parties to any Bodega Delivery Partner Agreement.

                  ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE DISPUTE. RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BODEGA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

                  III. Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver
                  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION VII BELOW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND BODEGA OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS (EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION VII BELOW), AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING ANY DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER IS NOT ENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF OR A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ALL APPEALS FROM THAT DECISION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED (OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL), THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF MAY PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF.

                  WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY
                  Any waiver by Bodega of any term of this Agreement must be in writing. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (see “Dispute Resolution” section III), if any portion of this Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, modified or replaced by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original provision as closely as possible. The remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.
